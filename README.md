# covid-data-visualizer-Node

This is backend server for my another [application](https://github.com/Ahmed067Abdullah/covid-data-visualizer-React). Previously, I was fetching data from https://covid19api.com/ but recently I noticed some ambiguities in their data so I decided to create my own APIs for it. Apart from GET API for fetching data, it also includes an API to scrap data directly from official website of Pakistan, i.e http://covid.gov.pk/ using ```puppeteer```. Right now, the scrapping has to be done manually everyday but I'm planning to automate that as well in the future.
